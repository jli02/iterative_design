            CUR8 is a carbon removal brokerage on a mission to remove 1 billion
            tonnes of carbon a year. They "curate" custom carbon removal
            portfolios according to customers' needs and goals. The startup has
            started designing a portfolio simulation tool, where customers can
            input requirements and generate a portfolio of removal projects.
            They have asked us to continue on their design to create a
            purchasing flow so that users can buy the portfolios that they have
            generated.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            <b>Problem Statement: </b>
            "CUR8's current manual carbon removal portfolio creation process
            limits user self-service and requires company assistance,
            constraining the user experience and slowing down customer
            acquisition."
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            We wanted to create an <b>intuitive, simple purchasing flow</b> with
            enough friction so that users can ensure that they are buying a
            portfolio that is best suited for their needs (as buying carbon
            removal projects can get very expensive!). We considered ways for
            customers to get feedback on their generated portfolios from
            stakeholders and how to make the process accessible to customers who
            might not have any prior experience with purchasing carbon removal
            projects.

          We each independently designed two solutions for the brief to get the
          widest possible spread of ideas for our mid-fidelity wireframe,
          resulting in 8 separate flows. While we did these independently, we
          realized that many aspects of our flows overlapped, which helped us
          decide what would be most intuitive for our first iteration of
          wireframes.

          In our sketches, we all had about the same pages: portfolio summary,
          cart and customer information, and a confirmation page. While we each
          broke different pages into multiple ones, we decided to begin with
          these three because they were the most essential based on our sketches
          and email with CUR8. We also added a collaborator page so that
          stakeholders can easily be added to the process, since the customers
          are usually teams working to determine their desired carbon tonnes
          removal and price.

          Our email to Vitor (our primary point of contact in CUR8) and feedback
          from TAs was helpful in the group's understanding of what we were
          supposed to do: create a payment flow. In turn, our group tried to
          make the payment flow as natural and simple as possible by picking up
          where the CUR8 high fidelity mockup left off on the project summary,
          then adding other stakeholders who will be involved in the purchase
          decision, then to the information and payment page that ended with a
          confirmation page. We only included the four pages we deemed necessary
          so we don't confuse the customer or lose them before they make it to
          the purchase page. While we felt like we were missing certain
          elements, such as a page dedicated to the breakdown of each project,
          we decided to keep it simple and allow Vitor to guide us with his
          feedback for the next iteration. On design, we didn’t want to
          implement our style guide in our early iterations because we were
          still grasping customer needs and the scope of our work and didn’t
          want to misrepresent the brand.

            <br />
            Vitor recommended adding a step between their portfolio simulator
            and our Step 5 (the first page of our wireframe) to give users more
            details and characteristics of specific projects that are included
            in their portfolio. He liked the step with adding stakeholders but
            encouraged us to be more creative with how we can allow stakeholders
            to leave feedback or comments. Likewise, he wanted us to send these
            stakeholders a more complete proposal of the portfolio, including a
            cost breakdown and projects included. Finally, he informed us that,
            realistically, users will not be able to purchase portfolios
            immediately but will instead have to send a purchase request to be
            approved by CUR8.

            <br />
            Talie advised us to revisit the Step 7 - Review Portfolio page and
            execute our vision of making it look like a receipt. Making the page
            look like a receipt was our original intention; however, hearing
            Talie’s feedback helped us realize that our vision was not coming
            across. We agreed on the left side of the screen being a portfolio
            summary and the right side containing a breakdown of each project.

            <b>Feedback from peers: </b>
            <br />
            One of our peers said that “there are no back buttons on the pages.
            I think adding back buttons would add a lot of usability so that
            purchasers can go back and fix a small mistake without having to
            start the whole process over again.” This was something we missed
            and went back to implement. Another one of our peers said that her
            “one piece of feedback would be to make the "headers" of your lo-fi
            designs shorter.” For example, turn "send the details of your
            portfolio to stakeholders for sign off" into a shortened version
            like "email stakeholders. We implemented this by making the names of
            our pages and descriptions shorter, such as “Step 7 - Review
            Portfolio.”

      <!-- updating wireframe -->
      <section class="full-section">
        <h1 class="header">Updated Wireframe</h1>

        <p class="body-text">
          After our studio critique and mid-project check-in with CUR8, we
          modified the wireframe to reflect the feedback we received. CUR8 liked
          our initial project breakdown but asked us to include more specifics
          on the project with characteristics on the speed of drawdown, tech or
          nature-based, durability, location, and the supplier company. Step 5
          below reflects those changes. Additionally, we added filters to allow
          the customer to filter projects in their portfolio by solution type so
          that they can more easily find the project they are looking for. CUR8
          also included feedback about allowing the stakeholders invited to the
          portfolio to leave feedback. Steps 7 and 8 on “flow 2” reflect the
          invite the invited stakeholders from step 6 would see. Upon clicking
          the “Go To Portfolio'' button in Step 7, the invited stakeholder will
          see a detailed portfolio breakdown and will also have the opportunity
          to leave comments, feedback, and questions about the portfolio in a
          chat section on the left. Stakeholders will be able to see feedback
          other members of their team have left and CUR8 can view this
          communication/feedback to understand how their clients are thinking
          about the portfolio. Continuing with Flow 1, we reflected CUR8’s
          feedback about updating the purchasing step to be a purchase request
          because realistically clients won’t be able to purchase the portfolio
          without CUR8’s approval. This request page includes important
          information CUR8 needs to approve the purchase request such as the
          client’s name, email, address, and the reason for the portfolio.
          Lastly, we added the request confirmation and a button that leads
          clients back to step 5 so they can see their portfolio again.

          CUR8 provided us with a style guide that was in line with their Brand
          identity. We followed that style guide to ensure that the flow we
          designed fit in well with their current website and branding. We
          believe the startup chose the neutral and earth tones and images they
          have to reflect their climate-oriented business. Their background
          color, a very pale cream, contrasts well with the forest greens that
          highlight buttons, and appear in many images and color pages across
          their site. Additionally, we followed their design for cards which we
          used to display project information in the portfolio and textboxes
          which we use for sending invites to collaborators, getting feedback
          from clients, and filling out text fields for purchase requests.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          We also chose to stick with their style guide because the brand kit
          CUR8 sent us was very consistent and reflected a strong brand
          identity. We don’t have suggestions for improving the style guide,
          because we felt it was already really well thought out and executed.

          For our high fidelity prototype, We chose colors that aligned with

          primarily cream, white, and green, and some deep purple, brown, and

          total costs based on their inputs. This page provides a breakdown of
          projects within the portfolio. The portfolio overview including total
          is at the top and users can filter by project type. The page is
          scrollable so users can scroll down and see other projects. There is a
          previous button that navigates back to CUR8’s overview floor and a
          next button that takes you to the next page. The bar at the top shows
          the users their progress throughout the process.

          users to invite collaborators to view their portfolios and give
          feedback comes up. The background becomes green to contrast the white
          pop-up. Once users invite stakeholders they can see whether the
          stakeholder has viewed the portfolio and can also click a button that
          takes them directly to the stakeholder’s comments. We gave users the
          choice to skip this step in case they are the only CFO at the company
          or does not need other internal approval. The pop nature of this step
          reflects its optionality. Additionally, the pop-up appearing over the
          portfolio breakdown indiciates to users that the portfolio from Step 5
          which is the background of the pop-up is what users are inviting
          stakeholders to view.

          Step 7: After users either choose to add stakeholders or skip that
          step, they will be led to step 7, a review page. The idea of this page
          was to mimic a receipt that provided an itemized list and breakdown of
          the projects in the portfolio, highlighting the total cost, and
          important project characteristics such as the supplier company,
          project type, carbon tonnes removed, drawdown speed, and durability.
          On the right-hand side, the page includes a summary of the total
          portfolio showing the breakdown of project type included in the
          itemized portfolio. The listed design mimics a receipt which is
          intentional and meant to evoke the feeling of reviewing items in your
          shopping cart before purchasing.

          Step 8 and 9: Once users review their portfolio, they are led to the
          purchase request page. If the user did not invite stakeholders in
          previous steps banner alert appears and the “open collaborators”
          button takes them back to Step 6 to invite stakeholders from their
          company to review the portfolio before the user submits a purchase
          request. If the user still wishes to not invite stakeholders, they can
          dismiss the notification. The second image shows the page users will
          see if 1) they already invite stakeholders in Step 6 and 2) if they
          click the “close notification” button. The top of this page includes
          important metrics such as the subtotal of the project and the carbon
          tonnes removed so users are reminded of their total and goal as they
          submit their purchase request. Users then fill out their information
          and submit the request. Upon submitting the request, users receive a
          confirmation message and can choose to return to their portfolio which
          will lead them back to Step 5 or exit the page.

          Importantly, we made a second flow which shows that invited
          stakeholders in step 6 will see.

        <p class="body-text">
          Once the user invites a stakeholder, the invited stakeholder will
          receive an email alert informing them that they have been invited to
          view their CUR8 portfolio solution where they can leave feedback and
          ask questions. The “Go To Portfolio” button leads users to the second
          page.

          Below is the page invited stakeholders are directed to when they click
          the “Go to portfolio” button. This page includes a summary breakdown
          of the portfolio solutions on the left. This summary includes project
          type, speed of removal, durability, and geographic representation of
          the project. The middle of the page includes the projects in the
          portfolio and their characteristics. The right side of the page
          includes a comment/chat feature where invited stakeholders can leave
          questions and feedback for the portfolio. The chat design encourages
          clients to communicate with their team and allows them to see the
          feedback and questions their team members have. This will be helpful
          for CUR8 because they can see how clients understand the project and
          the different questions and feedback they have on the portfolio.

          Additionally, in the main user flow in step 6, once the user has
          invited stakeholders, they can click the “see comments” button next to
          the invited stakeholder’s name once the stakeholder leaves a comment.
          This button leads them to the above page where stakeholders see the
          portfolio breakdown and leave comments and feedback.

            We really enjoyed this project and got a greater understanding of
            the iterative design process. It was helpful to get feedback from
            classmates, professors, and the CUR8 team since they each brought
            new insights. A purchasing flow is something we're all familiar with
            and seems rather straightforward, but we learned that there are
            actually very important considerations to make. We got to learn more
            about carbon removal portfolios and how you might structure a
            purchasing flow involving multiple stakeholders and users who might
            be new to the process as well. Since carbon removal portfolios are a
            complex product, they must be thoughtfully considered before buying,
            and we had to design a flow with enough friction and information so
            that users are satisfied with what they are purchasing.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            We learned a lot from this process and are super grateful to Vitor
            and the CUR8 team for giving us this opportunity!
